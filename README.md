# The Hacker-Docs theme
Hacker-Docs is a fork of the Hacker Jekyll theme which adds a wiki-style layout.

## Usage

To use the Hacker theme:

1. Add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

    ```yml
    remote_theme: morpheus636/hacker-docs-theme
    plugins:
    - jekyll-remote-theme # add this line to the plugins list if you already have one
    ```

2. Optionally, if you'd like to preview your site on your computer, add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
    ```

### Creating a Wiki Section
1. Add a collection to _config.yml
```yaml
collections:
  collection-name: # Replace collection-name with whatever you want to call your wiki section
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path
```
2. Create a directory for the collection in the root of the repository.
    - Jekyll expects collection directories to have the same name as the collection (as defined in _config.yml), but with an underscore (`_`) proceeding the name. i.e `_collection-name`.
3. Create pages within the collection.
    - Create markdown pages within the collection. Don't forget to include the following front-matter:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Page Name # Replace this with the title of the page
    position: 0 # This determines the order in which pages appear in the wiki sidebar. Lower number = higher on the list. 
    layout: wiki # Important - This is what tells Jekyll to render the page in the wiki format.
    ---
    ```
    - Note that each collection must have an `index.md` within it. 

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

Hacker will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
title: [The title of your site]
description: [A short description of your site's purpose]
```

Additionally, you may choose to set the following optional variables:

```yml
show_downloads: ["true" or "false" (unquoted) to indicate whether to provide a download URL]
google_analytics: [Your Google Analytics tracking ID]
```

### Stylesheet

If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site
2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:
    ```scss
    ---
    ---

    @import "{{ site.theme }}";
    ```
3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the `@import` line

*Note: If you'd like to change the theme's Sass variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet.*

### Layouts

If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout:

1. For some changes such as a custom `favicon`, you can add custom files in your local `_includes` folder. The files [provided with the theme](https://github.com/morpheus636/hacker-docs-theme/tree/master/_includes) provide a starting point and are included by the [original layout template](https://github.com/morpheus636/hacker-docs-theme/blob/master/_layouts/default.html).
2. For more extensive changes, [copy the original template](https://github.com/morpheus636/hacker-docs-theme/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) from the theme's repository<br />(*Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier*)
3. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site
4. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step
5. Customize the layout as you'd like

### Customizing Google Analytics code

Google has released several iterations to their Google Analytics code over the years since this theme was first created. If you would like to take advantage of the latest code, paste it into `_includes/head-custom-google-analytics.html` in your Jekyll site.

### Overriding GitHub-generated URLs

Templates often rely on URLs supplied by GitHub such as links to your repository or links to download your project. If you'd like to override one or more default URLs:

1. Look at [the template source](https://github.com/morpheus636/hacker-docs-theme/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) to determine the name of the variable. It will be in the form of `{{ site.github.zip_url }}`.
2. Specify the URL that you'd like the template to use in your site's `_config.yml`. For example, if the variable was `site.github.url`, you'd add the following:
    ```yml
    github:
      zip_url: http://example.com/download.zip
      another_url: another value
    ```
3. When your site is built, Jekyll will use the URL you specified, rather than the default one provided by GitHub.

*Note: You must remove the `site.` prefix, and each variable name (after the `github.`) should be indent with two space below `github:`.*

For more information, see [the Jekyll variables documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/).
